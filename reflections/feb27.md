In-the-wild evaluation of a creative technology has a benefit over traditional evaluation in that the communities and projects studied are not directly influenced by interaction with the makers of the technology. When we make creative technologies, we design for our own goals plus any that we can address through research about target users. Despite best efforts, it is unknown who would use the technology and for what purpose(s) until it is out in the world. If these users adopt the technology without the influence of its creators, their usage provides a purer datapoint for understanding the techno-cultural niche it fills. In-the-wild evaluation can also potentially encompass more users with unique use cases than could be managed in a traditional user study.

I see the primary limitations and challenges of in-the-wild evaluation as related to the ability to collect data about users and their projects, essentially how well they can be sought out via web search. Even when successfully located, project documentation may lack key background information sought by researchers, such as demographic information about its authors. I would suspect that in-the-wild evaluation is rare in HCI research because it requires the wide dissemination of the technology in question, which was possible in the case of the LilyPad because it became a commercial product, but is likely not viable in the majority of cases.
