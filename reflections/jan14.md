Csikszentmihalyi's definition of flow adds some new dimensions to the questions of creativity that we have been considering. Flow is a state of engagement in an activity in which we are adequately challenged for our current skill level, encouraging us to continue pursuing the end goal of that activity. This quality drives us towards increasingly complex states of accomplishment in our particular task. He argues that one of the reasons that Art has survived into the modern era is that it is a source of flow, implying that humans inherently crave the flow state. 

It struck me however that flow, as it is presented here, is a domain-general concept. While there are different elements that pre-dispose people to enter the flow state more or less easily, including their ability to concentrate, their degree of self-consciousness or self-centeredness, the family support they have enjoyed, their intrinsic motivation, etc., is this equally true of all flow activities, for all individuals? Or maybe the question to ask first is, what is the relationship of flow to creativity? Is a person who enters flow easily necessarily creative, or does this ability simply make it more possible for them to master a field, a pre-requisite for forming novel and appropriate contributions? If so, does this indicate some general basis for creativity?
