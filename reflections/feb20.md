The guidelines and categories for evaluation established in *Evaluation Strategies for HCI Toolkit Research* are interesting to contemplate and seem like a useful framework for assessing work in the space. Since the paper is informed by a wide survey of recent HCI toolkit research, its methods are proven; they are descriptive, not prescriptive. The concept of a "toolkit" was new to me while reading this paper. One question I had was around the boundaries of the definition of a toolkit. My understanding is that a toolkit is a set of software and/or hardware components meant to be used for the creative production of interactive systems. It is clear to me that a new programming language or a particular API could fall under this category. But could a creative software application? It seems to me that the various evaluation methods discussed (demonstration, user studies, performance analysis, and heuristics) could also be applied to novel music production or photo editing applications, for example. The paper states that some of the evaluation technique derives from software engineering, but these are primarily those related to benchmarking. How far can the concept of the toolkit be expanded? What, if anything, about this evaluation framework is specific to toolkits, if we do indeed consider them to have a more narrow definition?
