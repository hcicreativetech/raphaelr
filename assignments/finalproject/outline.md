# A Critical Analysis of Contemporary Graphic Sound Synthesis Software
### Raphael Radna<br>MAT-594X W20<br>March 12th, 2020

### Abstract
* Define Graphic Sound Synthesis
* Summarize history, major trends
* Pose research questions
* Describe analysis, naming 5 subject applications
* Summarize results, directions for new development

### Introduction
* Define Graphic Sound Synthesis
* Research questions
	* What mappings between visual forms and sound do the selected programs employ/support?
	* In what ways do the program interfaces enforce or create tension with these paradigms?
		* What interface features seem most desirable?
	* Where are the opportunity areas for the development of new software in this space?
	* Are there viable alternatives or augmentations to the sonographic model?
* Software to be analyzed
	* Applications
		* Metasynth
		* HighC
		* Virtual ANS
		* UPISketch
		* SketchSynth
	* Brief descriptions of the above
		* Developer, development history, interface, features, license, reception etc.
* Selection criteria
	* Because we seek design goals for new software building on recent work, we had these criteria for selecting software for analysis:
		* Contemporary
			* All software under recent or current development
		* Availability
			* Demo versions or open source/free software
			* Able to download from the internet
		* Compatibility
			* Ability to run on modern systems

### Background
* Overview
	* Properties of visual vs. sonic media
	* The problem of mapping
		* Physical vs. perceptual features
		* The frequency domain (sonographic) paradigm
			* Problem of pitch specificity
				* Difficult to draw deterministic harmonies, melodies
			* Timbre fatigue
				* Many timbres are poorly represented, cannot be synthesized by additive methods
			* Poor representation of perceptual qualities of sound
	* Graphic score specification (data visualization), or sonified art?
		* "musical drawing" vs. "visual composing"
		* Can the goals of visual and sonic art be aligned? Or do all systems privilege one over the other?
* Why is graphic sound synthesis interesting?
	* Affordances? Risks?
	* What can be created?
		* Visual art, sonic art, performance, something else?
	* Who can use this software?
		* Opportunity (boundary object?) for artists to enter a new domain, or for non-specialists to experiment with both modalities

### Methodology
* Methodology
	* Develop guidelines for analysis addressing several dimensions of comparison
		* These are things to help direct usage of the software, and organize thoughts while taking notes
		* e.g. facility of graphical interaction, quality of artistic expression, quality of musical expression, sense of correlation between graphic and sonic elements, customization of mappings (tinkerablity, programmability), novelty of interface, similarity to established digital art paradigms, similarity to established digital music paradigms
	* After a preliminary period of software usage, rate these for each application on a numerical scale
		* Use the software long enough, learn enough about it to create a short sound or composition
		* Apply the same criteria for each application
* Analyze mappings, noting if these are variable in any way
	* user-modifiable mappings, programmability

### Evaluation
* Present results
	* Sum up major takeaways for each application
	* Figures
		* Annotated interface(s)
			* How many? Can I do it for every app?
			* Display canvases showing what I made, mention how I made it?
		* Plotting the applications in a 2D or 3D space
			* According to ratings recorded using methodology referenced 

### Discussion
* Challenges in evaluation
	* Some programs have long history (Metasynth); some are brand new (SketchSynth)
		* Older projects will naturally have more robust feature sets
	* Some programs have detailed reference material, research publications; others don't
		* These resources could influence my exploration with the program
	* Some programs have an online user community; others don't
		* Online communities give context to a program's creation, usage
above
	* Other limitations of analytical approach
		* Difficulty in standardizing usage
			* didnt feel right to use a fixed time limit, since some programs are more complex than others, etc.
		* Only me
			* Could've been interesting to seek users of these applications
			* Also would like to get opinions from visual artists
				* Would they agree with my assessments?
* Findings
	* Identification of patterns emerging from results
		* What is common among the software analyzed?
		* What remains to be explored?
		* What should be avoided?

### Conclusion
* Restatement of research questions
* Synopsis of results
* Summary of potential directions based on analysis
* Implications of findings for development of new software
