### Raphael Radna<br>MAT-594X W20<br>March 12th, 2020

### Abstract
* Define Graphic Sound Synthesis
* Summarize history, major trends
* Describe analysis, naming 5 subject applications
* Summarize results, directions for new development

### Introduction
* Definition of Graphic Sound Synthesis
* Overview
	* Properties of visual vs. sonic media
	* The problem of mapping
		* Frequency domain (sonographic) paradigm
			* Problem of pitch specificity
				* Difficult to draw deterministic harmonies, melodies
			* Timbre fatigue
				* Many timbres can't by synthesized with additive methods
	* Graphic score specification (data visualization), or sonified art?
		* "musical drawing" vs. "visual composing"
		* Can the goals of visual and sonic art be aligned?
* Historic Systems
	* Analog
		* ANS, Oramics
	* Digital
		* Graphic 1, UPIC, Real-Time UPIC
* Software to be analyzed
	* Applications
		* Metasynth
		* HighC
		* Virtual ANS
		* UPISketch
		* SketchSynth
	* Brief descriptions of the above
		* Developer, development history, overview, license, etc.

### Motivation
* Background
	* Why is graphic sound synthesis interesting?
		* Affordances? Risks?
		* What can be created?
			* Visual art, sonic art, performance, something else?
		* Who can use them?
			* Opportunity (boundary object?) for artists to enter a new domain, or for novices to experiment with both
* Research questions
	* What mappings between visual forms and sound do the selected programs employ/support?
	* In what ways do the program interfaces enforce or create tension with these paradigms?
		* What interface features seem most desirable?
	* Where are the opportunity areas for the development of new software in this space?
	* Are there viable alternatives or augmentations to the sonographic model?
* Selection criteria
	* Contemporary
		* All software under recent or current development
	* Availability
		* Demo versions and open source/free software
	* Compatabillity
		* Ability to run on modern systems
	* The above were taken as more important considerations than specific features of the software

### Evaluation
* Methodology
	* Develop survey covering several dimensions of comparison
		* e.g. facility of graphical interaction, quality of artistic expression, quality of musical expression, sense of correlation between graphic and sonic elements, customization of mappings (tinkerablity, programmability), novelty of interface, similarity to established digital art paradigms, similarity to established digital music paradigms
	* After a preliminary period of software usage, rate these for each application on a numerical scale
		* use the same criteria for each application
* Analyze mappings, noting if these are variable in any way


### Discussion
* Challenges in evaluation
	* Some programs have long history (Metasynth); some are brand new (SketchSynth)
		* Older projects will naturally have more robust feature sets
	* Some programs have detailed reference material, research publications; other's don't
		* These resources could influence my exploration with the program by demystifying their use
	* Some programs have an online user community; others don't
		* Online communities
* Results
	* Figures
		* Annotated interface(s)
			* How many? Can I do it for every app?
		* Plotting the applications in 2D or 3D space
			* according to ratings recorded using methodology referenced above

### Conclusion
* Identification of patterns emerging from results
	* What is common among the software?
* Summary of potential directions based on analysis
* Implications of findings for development of new software
