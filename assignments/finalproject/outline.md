### Raphael Radna<br>MAT-594X W20<br>March 12th, 2020

### Abstract
* Define Graphic Sound Synthesis
* Summarize history, major trends
* Pose research questions
* Describe analysis, naming 5 subject applications
* Summarize results, directions for new development

### Introduction
* Definition of Graphic Sound Synthesis
* Overview
	* Properties of visual vs. sonic media
	* The problem of mapping
		* Physical vs. perceptual properties
		* The frequency domain (sonographic) paradigm
			* Problem of pitch specificity
				* Difficult to draw deterministic harmonies, melodies
			* Timbre fatigue
				* Many timbres are poorly represented, cannot be synthesized by additive methods
			* Poor representation of perceptual qualities of sound
	* Graphic score specification (data visualization), or sonified art?
		* "musical drawing" vs. "visual composing"
		* Can the goals of visual and sonic art be aligned? Or do all systems privilege one over the other?
* Software to be analyzed
	* Applications
		* Metasynth
		* HighC
		* Virtual ANS
		* UPISketch
		* SketchSynth
	* Brief descriptions of the above
		* Developer, development history, interface, features, license, reception etc.

### Motivation
* Background
	* Why is graphic sound synthesis interesting?
		* Affordances? Risks?
		* What can be created?
			* Visual art, sonic art, performance, something else?
		* Who can use this software?
			* Opportunity (boundary object?) for artists to enter a new domain, or for non-specialists to experiment with both modalities
* Research questions
	* What mappings between visual forms and sound do the selected programs employ/support?
	* In what ways do the program interfaces enforce or create tension with these paradigms?
		* What interface features seem most desirable?
	* Where are the opportunity areas for the development of new software in this space?
	* Are there viable alternatives or augmentations to the sonographic model?
* Selection criteria
	* Contemporary
		* All software under recent or current development
	* Availability
		* Demo versions or open source/free software
		* Available for download
	* Compatibillity
		* Ability to run on modern systems
	* The above considerations were taken as more important than specific features of the software

### Evaluation
* Methodology
	* Develop survey covering several dimensions of comparison
		* e.g. facility of graphical interaction, quality of artistic expression, quality of musical expression, sense of correlation between graphic and sonic elements, customization of mappings (tinkerablity, programmability), novelty of interface, similarity to established digital art paradigms, similarity to established digital music paradigms
	* After a preliminary period of software usage, rate these for each application on a numerical scale
		* use the same criteria for each application
* Analyze mappings, noting if these are variable in any way


### Discussion
* Challenges in evaluation
	* Some programs have long history (Metasynth); some are brand new (SketchSynth)
		* Older projects will naturally have more robust feature sets
	* Some programs have detailed reference material, research publications; other's don't
		* These resources could influence my exploration with the program
	* Some programs have an online user community; others don't
		* Online communities give context to a program's creation, usage
* Results
	* Figures
		* Annotated interface(s)
			* How many? Can I do it for every app?
		* Plotting the applications in 2D or 3D space
			* according to ratings recorded using methodology referenced above

### Conclusion
* Identification of patterns emerging from results
	* What is common among the software?
* Limitations of analytical approach
* Summary of potential directions based on analysis
* Implications of findings for development of new software
