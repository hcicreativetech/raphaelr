# Final Project Description

For my final paper I will survey and evaluate a selection of five current graphical sound synthesis applications. Evaluation will be conducted by reviewing available publications and documentation; studying the activity of online communities and user feedback if applicable; and reflecting on personal usage of the software. The applications that I intend to analyze include [MetaSynth](http://www.uisoftware.com/MetaSynth/), [HighC](https://highc.org/index.html), [Virtual ANS](https://warmplace.ru/soft/ans/), [UPISketch](http://www.centre-iannis-xenakis.org/upisketch?lang=en), and [SketchSynth](https://github.com/jeonghopark/SketchSynth-Simple). The paper will focus on the design choices embodied in each application, by considering how its interface affects possible workflows and creative outcomes. By analyzing the different ways that each developer has approached this problem, I hope to generate a set of potential design directions for my own software, with an eye towards discovering novel and under-explored opportunities in the space.
