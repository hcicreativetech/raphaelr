###Introduction
The following analysis of piano practice and performance considers both commonly-held beliefs in the field and insights from my personal experience to explore the domain through the lens of creativity support. Playing the piano is a demanding art form that engages both the body and mind. It requires a certain refinement of the ear and the development of specific motor controls, as well as the acquisition of specialized skills, such as reading music notation and conducting harmonic analysis. Successful development as a pianist necessitates regular lessons with a teacher, and an effective practice regimen, for which some suggestions are offered. Consideration is also given to some technologies and forms of collaboration available to the modern pianist.

###Process
The process of training as a pianist revolves around regular practice. Practice serves two purposes: to develop technique, and to learn new pieces. For the optimal experience, the pianist must select appropriate repertoire for their skill level; ideally, this is done in consultation with a teacher. If a piece is too challenging, the pianist may become frustrated, which can lead to burnout. In my view, it is impossible for a piece to be too easy, since musical interpretation always requires sensitivity and concentration, but a piano student could lose interest if they are given pieces that are far too simple for their level of development. Musical taste is an important consideration here as well; a pianist should enjoy the pieces that they study. 

The continuous loop between learning pieces and acquiring technique keeps the developing pianist engaged, while making accessible ever more-difficult repertoire. One way of advancing their playing is to learn an *étude*, a composition designed to train a particular pianistic technique, such as playing rapid arpeggios, crossing the hands, or bringing out the melody in an inner voice. *Études* hold a central position in piano pedagogy; they came to prominence in the 19th century as piano music began to demand increasingly more sophisticated technique. These pieces blur the distinction between didactic and musical value; certain composers, notably Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, wrote incredibly difficult showpiece *études* intended for concert performance. Incidentally, in the case of Chopin, they also pushed piano music forwards, since the techniques that he introduced were innovative for their time. Chopin *études* are now standard learning material for all Classical pianists.

To enter a state of flow more often and remain in it longer, I have found it helpful to make regular modifications to my practice routine. This can mean playing different studies and pieces on different days, but it could also mean setting aside time for improvisation and sight reading. Improvisation as an element of practice is a given for Jazz pianists, but other pianists also stand to gain from it the benefits of increased keyboard fluency and improved compositional instincts. Sight reading is a particularly important skill to practice for accompanists, and serves to improve music literacy, increase fluency at the keyboard, and introduce the player to new repertoire. Most of all, these activities break up the banality of a predictable practice routine.

###Learning
The art of playing the piano involves a process of interpretation whereby the pianist breathes life into a score, making audible the sounds encoded as signs on the page. Toward this aim, one goal of piano practice is to learn to play a particular piece of music. This implies both remembering the music (knowledge of how it sounds) and how to play it (where to place the fingers of each hand in order to reproduce it, and when). Interpretation embraces the whole text of a score; before it is possible, it is necessary to learn the notes.

In my practice, I have developed an effective method of learning notes. The first step is to select a musical fragment to learn; this should be short, around one or two measures. I then play it a few times with a few different fingerings, before settling on a mapping that applies an appropriate expression to the music, agrees with the preceding and subsequent musical material, and is comfortable for my hands. Once I have chosen a fingering, I annotate the music with it, along with any preliminary ideas about expression, articulation, and dynamics. At this point, I begin practicing the passage, starting at half of my target tempo. If I play the fragment three times in a row without playing a wrong note or inadvertently using an alternate fingering, I increase the tempo by four beats per minute. I continue this process until I succeed at the target tempo, then start over with a new fragment (usually the next one or two measures). If the music is particularly complex, I will first train each hand alone before putting them together. I have often found that, even if I conclude a practice session doubting my command over an excerpt learned in this fashion, I am usually able to play it with confidence the next day; to me, this is indicative of some offline learning process of which I am not fully aware.

There are two reasons why I focus so much on fingerings during practice. The first is interpretive; if a motif, phrase, or section recurs in a piece, it usually should be played with the same fingers, in order to render it with the same character. Practicing a single fingering strictly makes this innate. Learning fingerings in addition to the notes also serves a mnemonic purpose: it enforces the development of muscle memory. In recital, solo pianists are required to memorize music; therefore, memorization strategies during practice are critical. Fortunately, muscle memory is powerful; in my experience using the above method, I usually memorize a piece just by learning it.

Another aspect of learning to play the piano is the acquisition of specific control of the muscles in the back, shoulders, arms, wrist, and fingers. It is necessary to emphasize proper posture and positioning of the arm and hands, and to practice muscle relaxation, which is essential to developing touch, expression, and dynamics. Attaining these complicated and illusive aspects of playing require one to study with a teacher who can correct their technique and help them develop sensitivity towards the relationship between bodily tension and pianistic tone. Technical mastery enables the pianist to fully exploit the expressivity of the keyboard interface. Imitation of a teacher provides the initial model for learning both technique and interpretation. 

The study of music theory forms a third element of learning piano. For music of the common practice period (roughly 1600-1900), familiarity with the procedures of tonal harmony help the pianist to understand the music they are playing, improving recognition of the keyboard idioms employed as well as informing the interpretive apparatus.

###Materials and Mediums
Due to its immateriality, music has sometimes been called the most abstract art form. So what are the materials and mediums of piano performance? We might identify the air in which sound waves travel, and the time over which a composition begins, develops, and concludes. We may also observe that the music is mediated by a score, a piano, an acoustic space, and finally the pianist themself. Through their ability to interpret a score and realize a performance, the pianist becomes the medium. The text of the score is the starting point of this process; it is the pianist's role to fill in the unspecified details left by the composer as appropriately as possible for the musical context. The quality of a performance therefore depends on the pianist's ability to recognize affordances in a particular score for applying the techniques that they have developed, and then executing them aesthetically.

Additionally, there are several external materials and technologies available that benefit the pianist from the perspective of creativity support. The most ubiquitous (and previously mentioned) is sheet music. With a large music library, the pianist expands their potential repertoire. This increases the likelihood that they will select an appropriate piece for their technical level, an imperative for maintaining a state of flow and preventing burnout. Large music libraries also provide content for sight reading practice.

There are many sources for sheet music today. While there are less brick-and-mortar music shops than there once were, it is common to find older volumes in rummage stores and thrift shops; a sizable portion of my library was acquired this way. The majority of my remaining music comes from the online database of the [International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP)](https://imslp.org/wiki/Main_Page), a crowd-sourced compendium of public domain music from all eras, providing PDF downloads of historical editions from various print publishers as well as manuscripts, arrangements, and other rarities. For many musicians, IMSLP is the first stop when searching for the score to new repertoire.

The pencil is another traditional tool of the musician's trade, used to add fingerings, emphases, and other markings to scores during practice and rehearsal. Nowadays, musicians increasingly use tablet devices for reading, storing, and annotating their sheet music, facilitated by specialized score reader/librarian software. The digital domain enables non-destructive editing of a score, rapid search functionality based on metadata, and the ability to easily share scores. Some use these devices in conjunction with gesture tracking or Bluetooth pedals, which can be programmed to execute page turns without requiring the pianist to remove their hands from the keyboard. One drawback of using tablets for reading music can be their display size, as music is often printed on 9"x12" sheets of paper or larger; however, recent years have seen tablets produced at comparable sizes.

Other technologies relevant to the pianist include the metronome, a mechanical or electronic device that generates a regular pulse which can be helpful when learning notes (but less so when rehearsing interpretation), and recording devices, which provide an objective document of a musical performance. The metronome is a crucial component of my practice routine, in which I train fingerings at a slow tempo and gradually increase the speed. Listening back to recordings made during practice can provide insights about technique and interpretation that might otherwise go unnoticed, prompting adjustments that ultimately help us improve. 

### Collaboration
One could argue that the interpretive act of playing piano music is itself an act of collaboration with the composer, and generations of preceding pianistic tradition. However, apart from working with their teacher, the typical Classical solo pianist seldom collaborates directly with others. In fact, the image of the solo pianist is so engrained that "collaborative piano" developed as a separate specialization. Regardless, there are many possibilities for a pianist to work with other musicians, including piano duets (music for piano four hands or piano duo) and other forms of chamber music; vocal accompaniment; orchestral performance (such as in a piano concerto); and Jazz, Rock, or Pop ensembles. 

In chamber music ensembles, the performers actively communicate throughout a performance, including maintaining line of sight and giving clear physical cues, in order to coordinate entrances and convey intention. While each musician acts as a representative expert of their own instrument and makes decisions about the execution of their own part, issues of expression, articulation, and dynamics that affect the interpretation of the piece as a whole are discussed and resolved during rehearsal. In the special case of music for piano four hands (two pianists playing the same instrument), this spatial collaboration extends to the physicality of the situation: the players must negotiate control over sections of the keyboard at different times, operation of the pedals, or responsibility for particular page turns, among other considerations.

Vocal accompaniment is a much more asymmetric form of collaboration; decisions about tempo, rhythmic feel, and dynamics are all determined by the vocalist, and it is incumbent on the pianist to follow them during performance. In this context, the pianist does not have the same amount of creative liberty as the vocalist, and instead provides support for the vocal performance. Accompaniment for dance is similar.

The collaborative model of the piano concerto presents the opposite case, in which the pianist is a featured soloist accompanied by the orchestra. Traditionally, the pianist determines the tempo and character of the performance, and the orchestra follows them. In practice, the resulting interpretation is usually a compromise between the vision of the pianist and that of the conductor.

Finally, outside of Classical music, pianists collaborate in many contexts, including Jazz combos, Rock bands, and other ensembles of various formats and styles. Many of these offer highly collaborative musical situations, especially in the case of Jazz, in which musicians respond to each other's playing spontaneously during an improvised performance. All of these generally afford greater opportunities for collaboration than a Classical pianist will typically experience.
